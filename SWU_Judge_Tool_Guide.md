# Star Wars: Unlimited Judge Tool

There have been several requests for a website that gathers all data from almost every resource that would be useful in just about every judging scenario. The [Star Wars: Unlimited Judge Tool](https://donovandevelops.github.io/SWUJudgeTool/) combines several of these key resources into one place to make it easy to check rulings, see what a card does, what additional rulings or erratas have been established, and copies of the documents from the Cascade Nexus site. The following resources incorporated into the site include:
- [Card Information and images from the official Star Wars: Unlimited site](https://starwarsunlimited.com/cards)
- [Additional Rulings for cards from the official Star Wars: Unlimited site](https://starwarsunlimited.com/cards)
- [Comprehensive Rules (CR)](https://nexus.cascadegames.com/resources/)
- [Master Event Document (MED)](https://nexus.cascadegames.com/resources/)
- [Tournament Regulations (TR)](https://nexus.cascadegames.com/resources/)
- [Rules Clarifications from Nexus](https://nexus.cascadegames.com/resources/Rules_Clarifications/)
- [Policy Clarifications from Nexus](https://nexus.cascadegames.com/resources/Policy_Clarifications/)
- Card Legality

## Offline Use

***Before attempting to use the Star Wars: Unlimited Judge Tool offline for a competitive event, verify that you are able to load the site while in airplane mode without internet to verify that the site loads completely!***

In addition to being a wonderful combination of the frequently needed resources, this site is also designed to be available for offline use! There are a couple of restrictions with this as it is not a mobile app but a website, so results may vary based on the device and browser that is being used.
Generally - follow your browser's instructions for downloading a website for offline use.
- [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7343019?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#:~:text=Download%20a%20page%20from%20Chrome%20to%20read%20offline&text=save%20a%20page.-,On%20your%20computer%2C%20open%20Chrome.,page%20you%20want%20to%20save.&text=Choose%20where%20you%20want%20to,Select%20Save.)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-save-web-page)
- [Safari (Make sure Automatically Save Offline is on)](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/iphone/iph1a4721132/ios)

The download process can take up to or a little over 10 minutes to complete. The browser will try to download all of the images on the site, and there are a lot of them between card images and rules clarifications. It is okay if it seems like it is taking a while. The expected size is currently around or a little over 450 MB.

Once the download is complete, disconnect the device from the internet and attempt to load the site offline. Clear the session (close the browser app completely) to make sure that there isn't a live version of the website still being loaded. If launching the downloaded site looks exactly the same as before, then the site was downloaded successfully and will most likely be functional. If the site looks like normal text on a plain background and clicks to open card information proves unsuccessful, then the download did not work and the browser's download feature is not adequate to use the tool offline.

## Additional Notes
- As always, while this tool is very convenient to have on hand, make sure that there is a physical copy of the documents or a device with guaranteed connection to the internet as a backup in the event that the offline site does not load.
- Once dowloaded, the site will not update. Connecting to the live version of the site will make sure that the most up-to-date information is available, and you will need to delete the existing site download and redownload the site to capture the updates in the offline version.
- This site is completely written and maintained in English, including all of the card images that are provided in the card lookup.
- The site defaults to dark mode, but if light mode is preferred, select the white box next to the search bar and it will switch to light mode. Unfortunately, the preffered mode is not saved anywhere, so the box will need to be clicked every time the site is loaded.

## Site Guide
Here is a brief walkthrough of the different tabs available in the tool:
- **Cards**
  - This tab holds a significant amount of information about all cards that currently exist. It includes the card type (Leader, Base, Unit, etc.), the card's most recent set (relevant for rotation when that comes about), aspects, card images, and any text on the card. Some data, like the card text, can be different from one variant to the next, and is grouped underneath the image of that variant, where information like Additional Rules applies to all variants of a card.
  - A significant amount of the card data is searchable using the text box at the top. Searchable items include:
	  - Title
	  - Subtitle
	  - Text
	  - Deploy Box Text
	  - Epic Action Text
	  - Aspect Name
	  - Card Type (Unit, Leader, etc.)
	  - Set Abbreviation
	  - Traits
	  - Additional Rulings
  - Cards are sorted alphabetically by Title and then by Subtitle
- **Additional Rulings**
	- This tab is gathered through all of the Additional Rulings that are uploaded on the official Star Wars: Unlimited website.
	- The rules on this page are sorted by most recent released set to oldest set, and then by the name of the card that the ruling applies to, then finally by the date the ruling was made from most recent to least recent.
	- All of the text on this page is searchable through the search bar on the top of the page, so you can search for the name of a card, an interaction, or a date to see all of the related updates.
- **CR**
	- Simply put, this page hosts the current version of the Comprehensive Rules document. It also includes a direct link to the PDF for download separately.
	- *Note: If you see a message in red text above the document, then it means that you are viewing images of the PDF and not the PDF itself. Usually that indicates that your device or browser does not have a PDF viewer. All that means is that while you wont be able to search the text on the document or use it's embedded navigation, you'll be able to view the whole document as images. This will also be true for the MED and TR.*
- **MED**
	- Simply put, this page hosts the current version of the Master Event Document. It also includes a direct link to the PDF for download separately.
	- *Note: If you see a message in red text above the document, then it means that you are viewing images of the PDF and not the PDF itself.

This will also be true for the CR and TR.*
- **TR**
	- Simply put, this page hosts the current version of the Tournament Regulations document. It also includes a direct link to the PDF for download separately.
